# AST Playground

AST Playground is a web-based tool that allows users to interactively parse JavaScript code using a JavaScript parser. Users can input JavaScript code, select ECMAScript version, and source type. The output is displayed as an interactive, collapsible tree representing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the parsed code.
